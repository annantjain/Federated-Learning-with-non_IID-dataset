#Label-Divergent Federated Learning with Clean & Noisy Images

## Introduction

This project explores a federated learning setup where clients have limited clean images and diverse noisy images (e.g., snow, foggy) with differing label distributions. A methodology is developed to enable clients to utilize knowledge from a central server via compressed model exchanges. The approach ensures effective labeling of clean and noisy images without pretrained models, focusing on training to handle heterogeneous client environments
